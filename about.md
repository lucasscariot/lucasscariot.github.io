When I was 12 years old I came across the Social Network movie. As cheesy as it may sound, It was the thing that turned me into a programming addict. So much so that the next day on I transformed into a book worm consuming every source there was on coding. History, math and geography classes got replaced by the C, Javascript and algorithm basics.

The practical implementation was not far behind. As Facebook was blocked on school's computers, I decided to code an internal network that can replace it. It didn't repeat its predecessors success, but my classmates were happy. They particularly liked the banana currency feature - that one could use to send presents to a friend.

As coding was required energy refill and the cantine menu wasn't very inspiring, the only alternative was a over-crowded local pizza shop. Except for the one thing - the order was paper based. Euh. So I sold my first delivery website and became a loyal customer.

At 18 I left school to integrate 42.
